# Project Description

This project is a stock tracker application that includes data fetching, pattern detection, and API route definitions. The application is structured to separate core logic, data models, utilities, and configuration.

## Setup

Instructions on setting up the project will be added here. 

# üöÄ Stock Pattern Detection POC

## üß∞ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/assafzimand/Stock_Tracker.git
cd Stock_Tracker
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Start the stock price fetch scheduler (runs every 5 mins during US trading hours)
- Open your browser to the Swagger API docs automatically

## üåê Using the API

Once the server is running, go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Use the `/detect-pattern` endpoint to check for a **cup and handle** pattern.

### Request Body Example:
```json
{
  "company": "Apple",
  "include_plot": true
}
```

> üî∏ `company` must be one of:  
> `Apple`, `Microsoft`, `Alphabet`, `Amazon`, `Nvidia`, `Meta`, `Tesla`

---

### ‚úÖ Successful Response:
```json
{
  "company": "Apple",
  "pattern_detected": true,
  "plot_base64": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."
}
```
